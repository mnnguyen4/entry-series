		Hey! I'm Matt, and welcome to the homepage for
		the Entry Series, an art project focused primarily on
		having fun and drawing characters!</br></br>

		This project started around 2019, although some of the
		character designs are much older. Back then, I wanted to get more serious
		and learn what character design really meant. I thought I could do concept design
		as a job professionally. After looking at various
		books and tutorials and, with a bit of self-reflection, I
		realized that that wasn't what I wanted to go. So, I did
		it for fun :). </br></br>

	<div class="para" margin-right="0">
		The firery skeleton (name's Vexen) is my first ever drawing! The work
		of this project includes both traditional (ink, pencil, paint, etc.) and digital
		mediums (animations, illustrations, vector art). This website is mainly for reference,
		both for myself and others who may be interested. </br></br>

		You can contact me at candyalienman@gmail.com or @candysweetssjr on Instagram.
		Well, enjoy the art!
