# entry-series

Hey! My name is Matt, or CSJ for my artist tag. This project is a Github Page where I will be posting art-related content.
The purpose of this website is to:

  1) Learn HTML. My curiousity has always peaked at HTML ever since using using the inspect tool in Firefox, but I haven't really touched
  that type of markup language. Recently, I've done a Hackathon with a lot of HTML involved, and I'm finally diving into making websites!
  
  2) Organize my project online. I usually post my work on other social media sites, but it's a big hassle showing how certain works are
  connected. I want a single "post" with all the work for a single character, similar to a art portfolio page. I want a site that lets me
  continuously update my art and better show off my work to others in an organized way.
  
  3) Just have fun. It's my own website, and I get to screw around as much as possible. Thing are going to be wrong, but that's alright
  with me. Through this project, I'll have another idea to develop and look forward to, as this will take a long time to "finish". Art
  never really finishes, but I'll eventually call it done.

This write-up is mainly for reference to keep my goals in mind and to have something to look back to. If you're reading this, then
welcome, and hope you stick around! Nothing really else special with this project, just some HTML and images.
